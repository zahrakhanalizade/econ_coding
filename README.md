# Coding Practices for the Tech-Savvy Economist

This repository is a personal collection of coding examples, algorithms, and techniques that I’ve gathered and developed as an economics PhD student. The notebooks are products of a learning and review process for myself, and it’s still a work in progress. I hope it can also be useful for others working at the intersection of coding and economics.

## What's Inside?

1. **LeetCode-Style Questions**
   - A set of algorithm and data structure problems with solutions in Python.  
   - Includes some handy patterns that often show up when solving problems.

2. **DS/DA Notebook**
   - Walkthrough of core data structures that an economist may not use much, like heaps and hashmaps.  
   - Algorithm cheat sheets for quick review.

3. **Causal Machine Learning**
   - Examples and implementations of causal ML techniques.  
   - Functions and packages for estimating treatment effects and counterfactuals.

4. **Data Analysis**
   - Scripts for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.  
   - Examples using libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

5. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Implementations of common ML models.  
   - Includes regression, classification, clustering, decision trees, and more.

6. **Future Additions**
   - R and Stata scripts for econometric analysis.  
   - Causal inference methods such as Difference-in-Differences, Instrumental Variables, and Regression Discontinuity.

## Tools and Technologies

The main language here is Python because of its flexibility for data analysis and machine learning.  
Future additions may include R and Stata, and other tools as needed for specific methods.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zahrakhanalizade/econ_coding
   
2. Explore the notebooks and scripts based on your interests.

## Running in Colab

The way I usually like to open a GitHub-hosted notebook in Colab is by using the Chrome extension  
[**Open in Colab**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo).  
Once installed, it adds a little button that lets you launch notebooks straight into Colab from GitHub; no extra setup needed.  

(Alternatively, you can always copy the GitHub URL into [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) → *File → Open notebook → GitHub*.)
