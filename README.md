# Coding Practices for the Tech-Savvy Economist

Welcome to **Coding Practices for the Tech-Savvy Economist**! This repository is a personal collection of coding examples, algorithms, and techniques that I‚Äôve gathered and developed as an economics PhD student. It‚Äôs a work in progress, reflecting my journey in learning and applying coding skills to economic research and data analysis. I hope it can be a helpful resource for others who are navigating similar paths.

## üßë‚Äçüíª What's Inside?

This repository is a mix of practical coding examples, LeetCode-style problems, and tools that I‚Äôve found useful as an economist who codes. Here's what you'll find:

### 1. **LeetCode-Style Questions**
   - A collection of algorithmic and data structure problems to sharpen coding skills.
   - Solutions in Python.

### 2. **Causal Machine Learning**
   - Examples and implementations of causal ML techniques.
   - Packages and functions for estimating treatment effects, counterfactuals, and more.

### 3. **Data Analysis**
   - Practical scripts for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.
   - Examples using popular libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn'.

### 4. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Implementations of classic and modern ML models.
   - Examples include regression, classification, clustering, decision trees, and more.

### 5. **Future Additions** (Coming Soon!)
   - **R and Stata Codes**: Scripts for econometric analysis and data manipulation.
   - **Causal Inference Methods**: Implementations of techniques like Difference-in-Differences (DiD), Instrumental Variables (IV), and Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

This repository primarily uses **Python** for its versatility in data analysis and machine learning. Future additions may include:
- **R** for statistical computing and econometrics.
- **Stata** for econometric analysis.
- Other tools as needed for specific techniques.
