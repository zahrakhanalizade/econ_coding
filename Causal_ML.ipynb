        "\n",
        "Feature importance in causal forests measures how much each feature contributes to the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs). This allows researchers to identify which features drive variations in the causal effect across the population. It extends the concept of feature importance from standard random forests to a causal setting.\n",

        "In a study analyzing a marketing intervention, feature importance can reveal which user characteristics (e.g., age, location, or past behavior) most influence how the treatment (e.g., a coupon) affects purchasing behavior.\n",
